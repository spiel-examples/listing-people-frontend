# Listing People Frontend

This is a frontend example using [Spiel Client](https://github.com/spieljs/spiel-client). You will realize that I didn't create endpoints, instead of this I use [spiel-connect](https://github.com/spieljs/spiel-connect) which provide all the classes and methods that I need to call a some endpoint. Also I use [picostyle](https://github.com/morishitter/picostyle) to set styles to elements
